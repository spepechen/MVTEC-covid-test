# Project presentation slides with Rmarkdown

- Using the built-in `ioslides` package for .Rmd files in RStudio. 
- Style can be customized in the `styles.css` file.
- Makes use of `pandoc` engine for documents. It can be output into `pdf`, `LaTeX` or `MSPowerPoint` files as well as a static html documentation site like `bookdown` 
- Supports interactive html content such tables, charts, etc.


### Features
- Widely used syntax in .Rmd files mostly compatible with other presentation frameworks `slidify`, `reveal.js`


### Alternatives 
- [Reveal.js](https://github.com/rstudio/revealjs) is a better option for customizing the output, but seems not much conveninent exporting to pdf.
